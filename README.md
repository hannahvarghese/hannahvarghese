### 👋 Hi, I’m @hannahvarghese

I'm Hannah Varghese, and I am a former educator transitioning into Data Analytics. I have always found myself connected to data as a way to keep my curious thoughts organized, and have grown up to see how much data informs how the world works today and how the narratives can both positively or negatively shape different organizations, communities, and individual people.  

I'm excited to focus more on my Economics background and the coding skills I've recently acquired to provide data-informed solutions to model the way we can show up for others.  

### 👀 I’m interested in ... 
 * Helping organizations form decisions through data
 * Being able to take on and lead my own projects
 * Connecting on issues facing educators, students, and families to help districts make better decisions for students
 * Dissecting the environmental impact we make to make recommendations to combat climate change

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
A lot through the Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp from my alma mater, The University of Texas at Austin (hook 'em)🤘🏾! I have so much more to learn and am ready to soak it all in!
